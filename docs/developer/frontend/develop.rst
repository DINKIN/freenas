Developing for FreeNAS 10
=========================

Make Changes
------------

You're now ready to begin developing the new FreeNAS GUI. After running
``grunt``, any changes you make to watched files will immediately be
copied to the FreeNAS instance and if necessary, node will be restarted
to implement the changes.
