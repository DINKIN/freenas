If you want to donate money, don't give it to us - we prefer donations
to go to the
`FreeBSD Foundation <http://www.freebsdfoundation.org/donate/>`__. Everything
that makes FreeBSD better makes FreeNAS better as well, and by donating to
FreeBSD directly you help out the entire community, not just FreeNAS. The
FreeBSD Foundation is a 501(c)3 organization, so donations to the FreeBSD
Foundation may be tax-deductible in the United States.

iXsystems, the sponsors of FreeNAS, offer the
`TrueNAS Unified Storage Appliance <http://www.ixsystems.com/truenas>`__,
currently based on FreeNAS 9.3.
